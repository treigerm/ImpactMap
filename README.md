# ImpactMap

Millions of people around the world live in areas that are not covered on online mapping services. MSF's Missing Maps initiative is hosting Mapathons and sending volunteers to those areas to put people on the map.

However, for both volunteering mappers and communities, there was not an effective way to display the difference they made on the ground. We came up with ImpactMap to help people understand the impact they are having on communities. Their impact is much more than just an updated map - mapping communities means adding people with unstable water supply and limited access to communication means to a global network.

ImpactMap shows the evolution of a map over a specific period of time and helps users understand their impact on the community.
